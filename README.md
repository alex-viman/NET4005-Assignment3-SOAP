Publisher.java
- The SOAP API publishes service endpoints that allow Clients to interface with back-end server functions.
- This application supports two services: ServiceA and ServiceB
- Each Service has a front-end that listens for requests
- The front-end dispatches requests to one of two back-end servers in a Round Robin manner (load-balancing)

Client.java
- The Client interfaces with the SOAP API (Publisher) and sends it requests for both services
- The console output is for SOAP server replies
  - Replies are formatted as: Service# = server_ip:server_port

ServiceA.java
- A simple Interface for the service's supported functions

ServiceA_Impl.java
- This service listens for requests on port 8000 and dispatches them to back-end servers on ports 8001 or 8002
- Returns the server's response to the Client

ServiceB.java
- A simple Interface for the service's supported functions

ServiceB_Impl.java
- This service listens for requests on port 9000 and dispatches them to back-end servers on ports 9001 or 9002
- Returns the server's response to the Client
